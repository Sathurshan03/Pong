# Pong
This is a game called Pong where you bounce a ball using a pad. 
This game was made in my early times of learning programming, therefore, my methods of solutions are ineffective compared to my knowledge right now. 
To see the codes for this game, click on "Pong_SathurshanA", then click any file that ends with ".cs".
This game was mostly focused on reading and writing highscores, and using math to move a pciture on the screen.
(Note: not including "Designer.cs" files)
